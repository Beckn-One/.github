# Beckn One

## What is Beckn One?

Beckn One is a global networking infrastructure operated by the Networks for Humanity Foundation and its ecosystem partners. It is offered as a product suite designed for rapid setup, onboarding, deployment, and evolution of various transaction ecosystems across the globe. It is an ambitious project that aims to reimagine the deployment and adoption model of Beckn Protocol across the globe.

## Why do we need it and why now?

The following points outline the motivations behind the envisioning of Beckn One

1. Current adoption model of Beckn \- Launching networks, building network-specific communities, standards, using network orchestrators is not feasible at planetary scale and fraught with complications and bottlenecks.  
2. Trust is centralized \- The platforms of a Beckn-enabled network rely on network orchestrators for transaction integrity and trust establishment \- Any platform on the ONDC registry is assumed to be trusted  
3. Discovery is limited to a network broadcast and responses and doesn’t cover all discovery use cases  
4. Enabling cross-border transactions between businesses is complex and involves complicated deals and agreements between network orchestrators  
5. Policy and standards compliance is mandated and centralized to a network \- Any network launched for a domain region relies on the network orchestrator to recommend taxonomies, data standards, and policies  
6. Addition of new domains relies on new network-specific policies and compliance requirements requiring re-certification of all platforms wanting to include that domain

Beckn one aims to unbundle business / domain / region specific rules from the technical infrastructure. Similar to how the internet’s networking infrastructure allows for various policies (like firewalls, blacklists, SSL certifications, etc) to be programmed on the networking nodes and edge applications (like browsers and operating systems) without affecting the core routing protocols (TCP/IP, HTTP, etc) and hardware (servers, routers, etc). 

## The Vision 

The vision of Beckn-one is to revolutionize the beckn transaction landscape by creating a global, decentralized, permissionless, peer-to-peer (P2P) networking infrastructure that enables direct interactions between two transacting parties without relying on central network orchestrators for trust. This new paradigm seeks to emulate the internet’s boundaryless nature, allowing consumers and businesses to transact online seamlessly across domains and geographies.

## The Mission

The mission of Beckn One is to launch a fully operational global networking infrastructure by February 2026 capable of performing 1 Billion transactions per day across various regions and domains.
